# Darkmode-inator
## Tested Unity Versions:
* In newer versions you can change the skin in free Unity under preference settings
* Unity 2020.1.0f1
* Unity 2019.4.5f1

## How to use:
1. Download the latest Release: https://github.com/EobanZ/Darkmodeinator/releases
2. Drag an drop the original "Unity.exe" onto the "Darkinator.exe". 
3. Type your unity version in the open console and press enter. If yout type a random key or your unity version is not supported, it will try to find the bytes to patch by scanning for every known signature (takes longer). If the patching was successful, a new executable with the name "PatchedUnity.exe" is created.
3. Rename this new executable to "Unity.exe" and replace the original one (you should make a backup of the original).
4. Enjoy the Dark Theme
